<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>28 year old living in Cape Town, South Africa. 
  I have been working with computers my whole life, 
  and have decided to complete a web development course to build a portfolio and work towards my first Dev job.</p>

<p>I have a passion for travel and adventure. I love spending time with my family,
  and exploring the countryside. I enjoy good food, and spending time in nature. 
</p>

<p>I have worked in the hospitality industry as a barman & waiter for many years, before
  becoming an Online English Teacher for foreigners. While I was teaching, I also worked on 
  numerous movie sets as an extra or background actor. 
</p>


<p>I have experience coding in a number of languages such as C, Java and Python. My JavaScript is currently very basic, 
  and I have faint memory of how to use SQL. I am excited to improve my skills and create interactive Web Applications.
